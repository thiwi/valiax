// This setupProxy.js file configures a proxy middleware for the React development server.

// and forwards them to a specified target server. This allows the React dev server to act as a proxy,
// forwarding API calls to the backend server seamlessly.

// Choose the API URL based on the environment:
// - If the app is running inside a Docker container, the backend URL is provided via the REACT_APP_API_URL environment variable.
// - If running locally (outside Docker), it falls back to 'http://localhost:8000' as the backend server URL.
